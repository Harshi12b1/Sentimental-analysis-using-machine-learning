# Sentimental-analysis-using-machine-learning

Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining , deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.
Business: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people respond to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some products.
Politics: In political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the government level. It can be used to predict election results as well!
Public Actions: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere.
## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify the sentiment of tweets as either positive or negative. By training a logistic regression model on a large dataset of tweets, we can gauge public sentiment on topics and trends, which can be valuable for brands, marketing, and social analysis.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Sentiment140
Description: Contains 1.6 million tweets labeled for sentiment, where 0 represents negative and 1 represents positive sentiment.
Project Structure
Data Collection: Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
Data Preprocessing:
Removed special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
Converted text to lowercase for uniformity.
Removed stop words and applied stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
Feature Extraction:
Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features. TF-IDF helps by emphasizing words that are important within each tweet.
Modeling:
Trained a logistic regression model to classify tweets as positive or negative.
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate performance.
Evaluation:
Calculated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
Results
The logistic regression model achieved good accuracy in classifying tweet sentiment, demonstrating the effectiveness of text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction in natural language processing tasks.
